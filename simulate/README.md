# Simulate App

`simulate` is a fully-featured interactive application for MuJoCo. It opens an
OpenGL window using the platform-independent GLFW library, and renders the
simulation state in it. There is built-in help, simulation statistics, profiler,
sensor data plots. The model file can be specified as a command-line argument,
or loaded at runtime using drag-and-drop functionality. Below is a
screen-capture of simulate in action:
