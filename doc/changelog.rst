Changelog
=========

Version 2.1 (Oct. 18, 2021)
---------------------------

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Keyframes now have ``mocap_pos`` and ``mocap_quat`` fields (mpos and quat attributes in the XML) allowing mocap
   poses to be stored in keyframes.
2. New utility functions: ``mju_insertionSortInt`` (integer insertion sort) and ``mju_sigmoid`` (constructing a
   sigmoid from two half-quadratics).

General
^^^^^^^

3. The pre-allocated sizes in the virtual file system (VFS) increased to 2000 and 1000, to allow for larger projects.
#. The C structs in the ``mjuiItem`` union are now named, for compatibility.
#. Fixed: ``mjcb_contactfilter`` type is ``mjfConFilt`` (was ``mjfGeneric``).
#. Fixed: The array of sensors in ``mjCModel`` was not cleared.
#. Cleaned up cross-platform code (internal changes, not visible via the API).
#. Fixed a bug in parsing of XML ``texcoord`` data (related to number of vertices).
#. Fixed a bug in `simulate.cc <https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/sample/simulate.cc>`_ related to ``nkey``
   (the number of keyframes).
#. Accelerated collision detection in the presence of large numbers of non-colliding geoms (with ``contype==0 and
   conaffinity==0``).

UI
^^

11. Figure selection type changed from ``int`` to ``float``.
#. Figures now show data coordinates, when selection and highlight are enabled.
#. Changed ``mjMAXUIMULTI`` to 35, ``mjMAXUITEXT`` to 300, ``mjMAXUIRECT`` to 25.
#. Added collapsable sub-sections, implemented as separators with state: ``mjSEPCLOSED`` collapsed, ``mjSEPCLOSED+1``
   expanded.
#. Added ``mjITEM_RADIOLINE`` item type.
#. Added function ``mjui_addToSection`` to simplify UI section construction.
#. Added subplot titles to ``mjvFigure``.

Rendering
^^^^^^^^^

18. ``render_gl2`` guards against non-finite floating point data in the axis range computation.
#. ``render_gl2`` draws lines from back to front for better visibility.
#. Added function ``mjr_label`` (for text labels).
#. ``mjr_render`` exits immediately if ``ngeom==0``, to avoid errors from uninitialized scenes (e.g. ``frustrum==0``).
#. Added scissor box in ``mjr_render``, so we don't clear the entire window at every frame.


License manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

23. Removed the entire license manager. The functions ``mj_activate`` and ``mj_deactivate`` are still there for
    backward compabitibily, but now they do nothing and it is no longer necessary to call them.
#. Removed the remote license certificate functions ``mj_certXXX``.
